# CAESAR CIPHER PROGRAM
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption algorithm that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
This is a simple python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet.
